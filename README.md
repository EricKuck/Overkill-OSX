# Overkill-OSX
An App to stop iTunes and Photos from being annoying when you are working with Xcode


This is my first app OSX as boot camp developer!

This app is for OSX/iOS Developers who are tired of having iPhoto and iTunes open on them as they are doing development when detaching and attaching the usb cable.

This app will force quit those applications WHEN you have Xcode open.

This app was an idea I had originally, when I frequently left my mac to use the washroom or take walks and unplugged my iphone. The result plugging back in my iphone caused my mac to open Itunes and Photos. I found this super annoying. A week ago my friend had told me that someone had already created a Ruby script to do this. I was going to not release the app and was sad that someone beat me to it. Anyways I changed my mind and decided to do it and name it Overkill as an homage to Felix Krause. As I one day hope to be a great developer like he is.

This app will engage upon start.

It will only work if Xcode is open.
It will block iTunes from opening when Xcode is open.
It will block Photos from opening when Xcode is open.

That is that!

If you like this app please share with your friends.
Will add open on login as I figure out how that works. It is not very straight forward.
Feed back is greatly appreciated.

If Apple could copy this app, build it into OSX and call it Dev mode that would be sweet.

Features I want to add in the future, startup on login.
This doesn't appear to be working the API does not like me.

Then I want to add touchbar functionality not sure if it supports global touchbar keys or it is context specific.

My Macbook was stolen ... so my friend ArEnSc (Mike) lent me his laptop so I could continue this project, but he is leaving back to Canada soon :(
If you guys would be willing to help me visit my go fund me page.
